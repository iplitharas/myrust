/*
Everything in Rust is immutable by default.
We can use the mut keyword to make a variable mutable.
We can also shadow a variable by using the let keyword again.
Shadowing allows us to change the value of a variable without making it mutable.

for example:
```
let spaces = "   ";
let spaces = spaces.len();
```
The first spaces variable is a string type and the second spaces variable is a number type.
 Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with different names,
  such as spaces_str and spaces_num; instead, we can reuse the simpler spaces name.

/*
Shadowing is different from marking a variable as mut because 
weâ€™ll get a compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign
to this variable without using the let keyword. 
By using let,  we can perform a few transformations on a value but have the variable
be immutable after those transformations have been completed.
